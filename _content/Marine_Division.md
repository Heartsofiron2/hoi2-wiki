##  Notes 

-   Marine divisions are considered soft units.
-   Marines have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard attack
    values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a normal
    infantry of the same year.
-   Marines have less penalty performing [amphibious
    assaults](/wiki/Amphibious_assault "Amphibious assault") (the
    penalty is reduced even more the further along the tech tree you
    get) .
-   Marines have less difficulties fighting in marshes and jungles.
